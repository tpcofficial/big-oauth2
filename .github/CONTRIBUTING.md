### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for big-oauth2. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/blob/dudeisbrendan03-patch-1/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/---bug-report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check your node version(`node -v`).** a lot of issues may just be due to an unsupported version of node
* **Check the [package is up-to-date](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/packages/)**, outdated versions may contain now-patched issues, sometimes dependency version issues can also cause problems!
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#big-oauth2-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

 **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of big-oauth2) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of big-oauth2?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Atom from [the releases page](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of big-oauth2 are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `npm ls | grep "big-oauth"` in your terminal, or by checking the package.json\/package-lock.json in your project
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **How are you configuring your project?** There could be a simple misconfiguration
* **Are you using big-oauth2 with multiple providers?** If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single provider?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Atom, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/blob/dudeisbrendan03-patch-1/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/--feature-request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check your node version(`node -v`).** a lot of issues may just be due to an unsupported version of node
* **Check the [package is up-to-date](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/packages/)**, outdated versions may contain now-patched issues, sometimes dependency version issues can also cause problems!
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Atom which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Atom users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a [community provider](#big-oauth2-and-packages).
* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Atom's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Atom
- Enable a sustainable system for Atom's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

### big-oauth2 and providers

[Providers](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/tree/dudeisbrendan03-patch-1/providers) are pre-made configurations on how to communicate with a OAuth2 IdP.

Providers must follow a similar flow [comparable to others](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/blob/dudeisbrendan03-patch-1/providers/google.js) and use the [generic handler](https://github.com/tpcofficial/big-oauth2/blob/dudeisbrendan03-patch-1/providers/generic.js) for all requests.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
* Startt the commit message with an applicable emoji (some examples below, full guide at - [gitmoji.dev](http://gitmoji.dev/)):
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
    * :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
    * :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
    * :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
    * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug

### JavaScript Styleguide

***This is not in-use nor enforced at this time***

We are thinking about using the Google Style Guide, please ignore everything after this point

All JavaScript code is linted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export default class ClassName {

  }

  // Instead of:
  class ClassName {

  }
  export default ClassName
  ```
* Place requires in the following order:
    * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
    * Built in Atom and Electron Modules (such as `atom`, `remote`)
    * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with `static`)
    * Instance methods and properties
* [Avoid platform-dependent code](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/cross-platform-compatibility/)


### Specs Styleguide

- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) specs in the `./spec` folder.
- Treat `describe` as a noun or situation.
- Treat `it` as a statement about state or how an operation changes state.

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [AtomDoc](https://github.com/atom/atomdoc).
* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
    * Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
    * Reference instance methods with `{ClassName::methodName}`
    * Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all Atom repositories, but some are specific to `atom/atom`.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in [open issues across `atom/atom` and all Atom-owned packages which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+label%3Abug+label%3Aneeds-reproduction) or perhaps [open pull requests in `atom/atom` which haven't been reviewed yet](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+repo%3Aatom%2Fatom+comments%3A0). To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in `atom/atom` only and also across all Atom repositories. We  encourage you to read about [other search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue has a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on `atom/atom` if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.
